# Client Libraries Sample

For native applications the best way to authenticate and access Azure DevOps resources is using the [Client Libraries](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/integrate/concepts/dotnet-client-libraries?view=vsts). They are .NET libraries made to simplify integration with Azure DevOps and Team Foundation Server (2015 and later). They allow access to both the Traditional Client Object Model and [new REST APIs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/vsts/?view=vsts-rest-4.1).

## Sample Application

 This buildable sample will walk you through the steps to create an application which uses the [Client Libraries](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/integrate/concepts/dotnet-client-libraries?view=vsts) to open an interactive login prompt and use that authentication state to execute a user pre-defined query written in [Work Item Query Language](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb130198(v=vs.90).aspx). Query results are output into the console.

 ## Step 1: Clone or download vsts-auth-samples repository

From a shell or command line: 
```no-highlight
git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/vsts-auth-samples.git
```

## Step 2: Run the sample

1. Navigate to the sample in cloned repo `vsts-auth-samples/ClientLibraryConsoleAppSample/`
2. Use [Nuget package restore](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/consume-packages/package-restore) to ensure you have all dependencies installed
3. Open the solution file `ClientLibraryConsoleAppSample.csproj` in [Visual Studio 2017](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/)
4. Open CS file `Program.cs` and there is a section with input values to change at the top of the class:
    * `azureDevOpsOrganizationUrl` - Mutable value. This is the url to your Azure DevOps/TFS collection, e.g. http://dev.azure.com/organization for Azure DevOps or http://myserver:8080/tfs/DefaultCollection for TFS.
5. Build and run solution. After running you should see a list of the IDs all work items which match your query restrictions.
